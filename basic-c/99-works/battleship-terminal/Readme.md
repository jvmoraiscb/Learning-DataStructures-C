Final work of the first semester of Computer Engineering (Federal University of Esp√≠rito Santo) in the discipline Programming 2.

The work consists of a Naval Battle game played by the terminal. The path of the main folder must be started as a parameter ("Batalha_Naval/Visiveis/Testes/01" for example). The boards can either be made (by creating the files "tabu_1.txt" and "tabu_2.txt" in the main folder) or randomly generated through the parameter "-gt". At the end of the match the statistics will be saved in the output folder ("saida"), previously presented in the main folder.

The folder displays the tests that were performed ("Testes") and how it presented the results ("Gabarito").

The final grade was 10 (100%).
